That is Perfection
Write a program to determine whether a number N is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors(excluding the number itself).
The first input is the number of test cases, followed by inputs one by one
Input format:
First line number of test cases followed by the inputs(N).
Output format:
Print YES ,if N is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors else print NO.
Constraints:
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤109

Approach 1:

a=int(input())
b=[]
for i in range(a):
    b.append(int(input())) 
for i in range(len(b)):
    c=[]
    for j in range(1,100):
        if b[i]%j==0:
            if j<b[i]:
                c.append(j)
    d=sum(c) 
    if d==b[i]:
        print("YES") 
    else:
        print("NO")


Approach 2:

n=int(input())
a=[int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    c=[]
    for j in range(1,a[i]):
        if a[i]%j==0:
            c.append(j)
    if sum(c)==a[i]:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

Sample Input
3
6
5
28

Sample output:
YES
NO
YES

Explanation:
6=1+2+3,so it is perfect
5=1,so it is not perfect
28=1+2+4+7+14,so it is perfect
