You are given a string num, having digits and numbers. Return the largest-valued odd digit or "Odd Number doesn't exist" if no odd integer exists. Ignore all the non digit characters in the string
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

a=input()
c=[]
for i in a:
    if i.isdigit():
        if int(i)%2!=0:
           c.append(i)
if len(c)>0:
    print(max(c))
else:
    print("Odd Number doesn't exist")



Input1: 
num = "TR52"

Output1: 
"5"

Input2: 
num = "SH4206"

Output2: 
"Odd Number doesn't exist"

Explanation: There are no odd digits in "SH4206"
