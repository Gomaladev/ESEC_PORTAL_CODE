There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.
The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.
The garden is on the left side of the building. a building has a garden view if all the buildings to the left have a smaller view.
Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order
Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an garden view, sorted in increasing order.
